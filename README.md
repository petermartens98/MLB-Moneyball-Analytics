## Project Descriptions:

### MLB Batting Heat Maps for 2018 Data.ipynb

Python Jupyter notebook that takes in 2018 MLB advanced media data, and then uses matplotlib to create heatmaps for all the balls put into play during the 2018 season. Largely utilizing pandas, numpy and matplotlib

### Multivariate Linear Regression using 2021 MLB batting data.ipynb

Python jupyter notebook that takes in 2021 MLB batting data (OBP and HITs) and by using a multivariate linear regression model,    can predict batting average on test data with an R squared of 0.74

### The-Baseball-Labor-Markets-Valuation-of-On-Base-and-Slugging-Percentage ~ Hakes and Sauer Table 3.ipynb

Python Jupyter notebook that reproduces table 3 of Hakes and Sauer (Moneyball analysis) by running linear regressions on Salary ~ OBP and SLG from 2000 to 2004. Utilizing pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, abn statsmodel libraries.

### The Impact of OBP and SLG on Winning for 1999-2003 MLB (Reproducing Hakes and Sauer Table 1).ipynb

Python Jupyter notebook that reproduces table 1 of Hakes and Sauer (Same Analysis used in moneyball). This table compares the impact of OBP and SLG on winning percentage. Utilizing pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and statsmodels libraries.
